They often taste bad and contain added chemicals in place of good ol’ fashioned sugar. This diet cranberry juice, on the other hand, is some of the best cranberry juice we tried. It’s actually very tasty; it tastes less like artificial sweeteners than other diet cranberry juices. Ocean Spray’s diet cranberry juice is better than some non-diet versions of other cranberry juices on the market. You can always bet on Ocean Spray! This cranberry juice does have one gram of sugar, but it’s about as close as you can get to the best cranberry juice without sugar.&nbsp; —Jordan Myrick</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#b14e4f></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best Unsweetened: 365 Organic Pure Cranberry Juice" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RANKING-UPDATE_CRANBERRY-JUICE_INSET-07.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Unsweetened</p><strong>365 Organic Pure Cranberry Juice</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Pure cranberry juice is a lot. Most people do not like or want pure cranberry juice, they want cranberry juice cocktail. I know this because I spent a full year giving out free samples of pure, unsweetened cranberry juice in grocery stores when I was in college. I would warn people that it was very strong and not sweet at all, and they would still proceed to grab a tiny cup, chug it down, and then choke on the bitterness. Then they’d yell at me for giving them something that tastes bad. So please don’t yell at me if you try this and don’t like it! It doesn’t taste good! But if you’re looking for pure cranberry juice for health benefits, this is the best cranberry juice we tasted. Trust me, I’m an actual expert on this. —Jordan Myrick</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#c6414f></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best Light: Ocean Spray Pink Cranberry" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RANKING-UPDATE_CRANBERRY-JUICE_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Pink</p><strong>Ocean Spray Pink Cranberry</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Ocean Spray Pink Cranberry is the most popular girl in the school. There isn’t an ounce of bitterness in her light, bright, and sparkly complexion. She’s like Cady Heron in the first half hour of Mean Girls—new, shiny, pink, and likable to everyone. She’s the best cranberry juice to drink for people who don’t like cranberry juice. According to Ocean Spray, this pink cranberry juice is made from a mix of red, white, and pink cranberries to create a crisp, refreshing flavor. Some people might turn up their nose at this and call it “watered down cranberry juice,” but overall, it’s actually quite pleasant. It’s a great addition to any cocktail or <a href=#>mocktail</a> that may call for a more muted cranberry tang. —Ariana Losch</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#b24247></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/happy-belly-RANKING-UPDATE_CRANBERRY-JUICE_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Budget</strong></p><strong>Happy Belly Cranberry Juice Cocktail</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>If you’re splurging on the expensive vodka, why not save a few bucks on your cran? Currently selling for $2.86, Amazon’s Happy Belly cranberry juice is a great affordable option among the best cranberry juice brands. The flavor is round and smooth but not too mild—you’re still getting that lip-pursing tartness and bright tang. This isn’t a juice blend, so the ingredients are pretty straightforward: water, cranberry juice (from concentrate), sugar, vitamin C, and vegetable concentrate for color. It has a simple flavor, but it doesn’t taste cheap—seriously, unless you’re a cranberry juice sommelier, you won’t be able to tell the difference between this and other lightly sweetened cranberry juices we recommend. —Ariana Losch</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#ac3b40></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best for Cocktails: Simply Cranberry Cocktail" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RANKING-UPDATE_CRANBERRY-JUICE_INSET-06.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Cocktails</p><strong>Simply Cranberry Cocktail</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Coincidentally, this cranberry juice cocktail is the best cranberry juice for vodka and, you guessed it, cocktails. It has such a wonderful flavor that feels a little more mature than some of the other brands we tried, which obviously made me want to mix it with booze. I think it’s because this juice is a little more mellow and not so sweet. If you’ve had other products from Simply, you shouldn’t be surprised that this took the #3 spot on our list. These people know how to make tasty fruit-based drinks. —Jordan Myrick</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#af4247></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best Bulk: Kirkland Signature Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RANKING-UPDATE_CRANBERRY-JUICE_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Bulk</p><strong>Kirkland Signature Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Costco</a><p>Fun fact: Kirkland Signature Cranberry Juice is actually made by Ocean Spray, and yes, you can taste the similarities. Both source cranberries from same <a href=# rel=noopener>North American farmers</a> and include most of the same ingredients, with one key difference—Ocean Spray (spoiler: our #1 pick for the best cranberry juice) uses a juice blend of cranberry, grape, apple, and pear. Kirkland (aka Costco’s house brand) skips the pear juice entirely and sticks with those first three juices instead. The result is a deep, robust flavor that’s incredibly hard to fault. It’s tart, bitter, and lightly sweet on the finish, with no added sugars or preservatives. The only downside here is that you have to buy two at a time. (Though, when you’re buying some of the best cranberry juice on the market, I’m not sure that’s a downside.)&nbsp; —Ariana Losch</p><p class=has-small-font-size>Credit: Liv Averett / Costco</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#ae3e45></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best Juice Blend: Nature’s Nectar 100% Juice Cranberry Flavored Juice Blend" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RANKING-UPDATE_CRANBERRY-JUICE_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Juice Blend</p><strong>Nature’s Nectar 100% Juice Cranberry Flavored Juice Blend</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>This was my personal favorite cranberry juice we tried. It’s cranberry forward, but it also has gentle hints of apple. It’s the perfect fruit blend. It’s not too sweet or too tart. Plus, it’s actually 100% fruit! I could drink a whole glass of this, easily. And since it’s from Aldi, I can! It’s super affordable and easy to find (as long as you have an Aldi nearby). That always adds a ton of extra bonus points for me.
