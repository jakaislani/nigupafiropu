And when he makes the trip back to our reality, the character is, for lack of a better word, buck naked.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Shooting that sequence has apparently been every bit as fun as you can imagine for Tom Sturridge himself, who’s portraying Morpheus in all of his dream-like glory in the Netflix adaptation. In a new chat with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Spy</a>, the actor broke down the sequence in question by highlighting the well-reasoned embarrassing aspect of being naked inside a spherical glass.</p><p>“For me as an actor, it is what it is. It was embarrassing. It was my first month on set. No one knew me. You’re like, ‘Hey, this is me!’ I was in that sphere, and they couldn’t open it, because it took too long. And because it’s a glass sphere, you can’t have a blanket in between takes, because it’s glass, and the blanket would still be there when you shot. So I’m literally just sitting there for hours, and kind of – when they say cut – going, ‘Hi…’ So that was that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220606_183446.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220606_183527.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220606_183507.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220606_184128.jpg><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=86 data-injectable=false>Sturridge also explained why it was important for audiences to see Morpheus like that.</p><p>“As far as the character goes, it was really important.
