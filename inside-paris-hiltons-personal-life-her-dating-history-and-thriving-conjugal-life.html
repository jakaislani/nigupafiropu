But it was in 2019 that the glitzy Hilton and Carter struck up a romance. Hilton and Carter have <strong>Halle Hammond,</strong> Carter's sister, to be thankful for. It was at Hammond's 2019 Thanksgiving gathering that Hilton and Reum redefined their relationship. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Simple Life</i> star and her then-new beau went Instagram official within months of dating, and fast forward to Hilton's 40th birthday in 2021, the venture capitalist proposed to Hilton in the most romantic way imaginable.
