Many of them have families and are always glad to celebrate with them. Admittedly, this championship season has been very hectic and fiercely contested, so some respite was welcome.</p><p>This year, a fair number of NASCAR drivers elected to spend time with their kin and celebrate the holiday. Among the party-goers were Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin, Brad Keselowski and Chase Briscoe. Even the likes of Joey Logano, Noah Gragson, Corey LaJoie and more, celebrated the holiday.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>How did the NASCAR drivers celebrate Halloween?</h2><p>First and foremost, NASCAR living legend Jimmie Johnson, celebrated with his two daughters. The older child sported a tiara and dressed as the Disney princess, Elsa. Meanwhile, his younger daughter wore a cute costume with a black hat. Johnson and his wife were also fairly well-dressed, though the former driver opted for more casual wear.</p><p>Meanwhile, young Brexton Busch opted to go trick-or-treating dressed as the famous Autobot, Bumblebee. On previous occasions, Kyle and Samantha also dressed up along with their son. Highlights included Batman, Joker and Poison Ivy, Mario, Princess Peach and Bowser, 80s pop stars and more.</p><p>Denny Hamlin also got in on the Halloween action, and his ‘costume’ was hilarious. Apparently, he had a lot of tattoos, so he was sort of resembling the music artist Post Malone. Hamlin’s look was inspired by the music video of Malone’s song ‘Motley Crew’.</p><p>It was the kids’ show once again, this time with Brad Keselowski’s daughter. Young Scarlett Keselowski wore a frilly yellow dress, and she looked extremely excited.</p><p>Teammate Joey Logano also had a blast, this Halloween, with his family celebration. As it turns out, his celebration was inspired by the Back to the Future movie, and he was dressed as Doc Brown. To make it even more authentic, Logano even drove the famous DeLorean out of his garage.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>They were the the only drivers having fun</h2><p>Corey LaJoie had his son Levi dress up as stunt performer Evel Knievel. To completely sell the costume, Levi even rode on a bicycle down a ramp.</p><p>Noah Gragson and a friend, had their costumes inspired by the Will Ferrell movie, Blades of Glory. Gragson was dressed as Jon Heder’s character, Jimmy MacElroy.</p><p>Finally, Aric Almirola and his family used lighting technology to create a unique family costume. To be precise, when the lights turned out, stick figures replaced the NASCAR driver and his family.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nascar-news-watch-denny-hamlin-cheekily-teases-wearing-a-post-malone-inspired-race-suit-at-martinsville?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210211151052/GettyImages-1183634873-418x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">WATCH: Denny Hamlin Cheekily Teases Wearing a Post Malone-Inspired Race Suit at Martinsville</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82aqpyZomK7psPSZq6arJOdeq%2Bt0pyYq2WUp7a3sdGsZJydnJqvs63TnmShmZyhvLixxKdksKGknXq1tMSiqWaekaK2rbXErGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
