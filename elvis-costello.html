Inspired by the musical freedom left in the wake of the Sex Pistols, Costello threw off the shackles of his workaday office job as a computer programmer and played his first gig in 1970, performing his own compositions in a London folk club. He took the stage name Elvis Costello in the late 1970s, when he was first signed to a record label.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Debut Album: 'My Aim Is True'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Costello released a stellar debut album, My Aim Is True, on the small British label Stiff in 1977; the album included such hits as "Alison" and "(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes."

Costello was joined by the Attractions, a three-piece group, on his second album, This Year's Model (released in 1978 and including the hit "Pump It Up"), and would continue to work with the trio on most of his albums for the next eight years.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Icon of New Wave</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Costello scored his first U.S. Top 40 single in 1983 with "Everyday I Write the Book," from the album Punch the Clock (1983), which also included the popular single "Shipbuilding," a collaboration between Costello and Clive Langer. Later hits include "Veronica," from his 1989 album Spike—named in reference to wacky 1940s band leader Spike Jones—and "The Other Side of Summer," from 1991's Mighty Like a Rose.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Known for inventive collaborations, Costello has recorded with numerous musicians, including rock/pop icons <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/paul-mccartney data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paul McCartney" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/burt-bacharach data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Burt Bacharach" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Burt Bacharach</a>, with whom he won a Grammy Award in 1999 for "I Still Have That Other Girl" (best pop collaboration with vocals).
