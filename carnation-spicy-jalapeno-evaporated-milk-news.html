To be more specific, this summer, dry milk consumers will get to enjoy Carnation Kickin’ Jalapeño Flavored Evaporated Milk in their macaroni and cheese. (Evaporated milk is not to be confused with its sweetened alternative known as condensed milk, which would probably taste even stranger if someone made it spicy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Prior to writing this article, my evaporated milk knowledge boiled down (heh) to just the basics: It’s shelf-stable and it’s a potential substitute for baby formula. After asking around, I found out I was clearly missing out on something special; the Southerners in my life all lit up when I asked if Carnation really belonged in macaroni and cheese. Of course, those same folks were less excited when I told them why I was asking. Not many people really got behind the concept of “spicy dairy” and I can’t blame them. To quote a relative of mine, “that ain’t right.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Where can I get this oxymoron-in-a-can?</h3><p>Carnation Kickin’ Jalapeño Flavored Evaporated Milk is only available inside Carnation’s “Mac It Better” kits, made in partnership with TikToker Tineke Younger (aka <a href=# rel=noopener>@Tini</a>) whose <a href=# rel=noopener>mac and cheese recipe</a> (made with evaporated milk and “corkscrew” pasta) went viral last year. They’re giving these kids out through a <a href=# rel=noopener>dedicated website</a> in timed drops. Unfortunately, the first drop date has already passed us by, but you’ll have your chance again soon; Drops #2 and #3 are taking place on July 9th and 14th. You’ll have to be quick though; Carnation is offering just 175 “Mac It Better” kits across the entire promotion.</p><p>Each kit comes with Tini’s recipe, a can of regular Carnation Evaporated Milk, a can of this new spicy evaporated milk, and a $25 gift card for all the other ingredients.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Is this really going to make macaroni and cheese better?</h3><p>Listen, I’m a macaroni and cheese purist. I’ve had plenty of “innovations” and I’m still not convinced we need to invite any new textures and flavors to this party. I’ll flip a picnic table if someone brings a batch topped with bread crumbs to my god-fearing American cookout. My only concession is that a good “<a href=# rel=noopener>piggy mac</a>” is absolutely divine. That said, I’ve primarily had that combination in the form of macaroni and cheese being the topping to a good pulled pork, so maybe that’s the important distinction. Speaking of using macaroni and cheese as a topping, weren’t we promised <a href=#>Mac on Tap</a> by Stouffer’s a few years ago? Are they still patenting the macaroni kegs? Where is my on-demand pasta sludge!?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJuRp7uiwMiopWaroJ6wunnJmqOaqJWjvG6x1ZqnqKqRqbKlecyio6RlnprEtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
