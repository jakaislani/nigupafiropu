Before his performance, Ben Trigger opened up about how he struggled to find acceptance for being “big” and “gay.” Even though his dance teacher bullied him for his weight, he stuck with the dance school and graduated so that he could get closer to reaching his dance dreams. At auditions, however, he said they would cut him after seeing him in the audition line-up, without even seeing him dance. He revealed that his dream was to be on Broadway before he badly dislocated his knee when he was 18.</p><p>Trigger walked onto the stage in a suit, barefoot. He began by showcasing his big personality and dance technique with his jazzy choreography before doing a striptease of his gold suit jacket, undershirt, and pants, revealing a black bodysuit with nipple tassels. He stepped down off the stage and continued his performance interacting with the judges. He turned his attention to Julianne Hough and Gabrielle Union, and leaned back onto the table between them to finish his dance. When he leaned back, however, his body weight triggered the Golden Buzzer and sent golden confetti raining down onto the stage and audience. Although the golden buzzer press obviously didn’t count, all four judges agreed to send Trigger through to the next round for his lively dance routine.</p><p>https://youtu.be/O4TPSVMdhp4</p><p>The golden buzzers actually given out so far this season were received by blind singer and pianist Kodi Lee (given by Gabrielle Union), 11-year-old violinist Tyler Butler-Figueroa (given by Simon Cowell), singer/songwriter Joseph Allen (given by Howie Mandel), and the Detroit Youth Choir (given by Terry Crews). Julianne Hough still has her golden buzzer to give out to an act she believes deserves to go straight to the live round of the competition; according to Hough, she will be giving out the last golden buzzer of the season during the July 9 episode.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ben-trigger-nationality></span> Ben Trigger Nationality<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trigger is of Australian nationality.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ben-trigger-twitter></span> Ben Trigger Twitter<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by TriggerHappy</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqVo3q1vsignp6qXay2rLWMm6CoZZGcsm6txq1kqZmimru1v4ygmLJllpa6qrjYZp6opJSau26u1LOxnqpdnbKqs8etZKeZpJ68r63LoquyZZWpta%2B1wqKrsmWRo7Futc2sq5qfopa6cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
