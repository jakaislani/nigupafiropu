She is the winner of two beauty pageants and the wife of Roy Bryant, an ex-soldier from Manitoba’s Ex-Soldiers and Ex-Sailors Party.</p><p>The couple has two sons together, however, Carolyn later divorced Roy and remarried two more times.</p><p>Talking about the accusation, Carolyn was accused of being a medium for the death of Emmett Till.</p><p>According to the records, Till was accused of canoodling with Bryant or whistling at her. Till’s interaction with Bryant, perhaps unintentionally, violated the Jim Crow-era South’s unwritten standard of behavior for a young black man interacting with a white female.</p><p>Bryant’s husband Roy and his half-brother J.W. Milam visited Till’s great-house uncle’s with armed weapons several nights after the incidents.</p><p>They kidnapped him, mutilated him, shot him in the head, and threw his body into the Tallahatchie River. Till’s body was recovered from the river three days later.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-carolyn-bryant-donham-today></span>Where Is Carolyn Bryant Donham Today?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carolyn Bryant Donham is out there somewhere living her life as she was declared not guilty of Till’s murder.</p><p>However, today, people are enraged at Carolyn as a result of the&nbsp;Women&nbsp;of the Movement (ABC) coverage of the Emmett Till murder.</p><p>Earlier in 1995, she had testified that a 14-year-old Emmet Till held her hand, confronted her, and flirted with her after purchasing some gum from her store.</p><p>In her testimony, she said that when Till made his way for the payment, he said, “How about a date, baby?” And following the story, Roy Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam decided they had to kill Till.</p><p>But in the ABC program, “Women of the Movement” today, it was revealed that everything she shared about Till’s verbal and physical advances on her was false.</p><p>In 2018, in Timothy Tyson’s book The Blood of Emmett Till, Tyson also stated that Carolyn Bryant Donham publicly denied her testimony of Emmett’s sexual advances.</p><p>And that she had fabricated those parts of the story.&nbsp; When asked about the incident that night, she claimed that she couldn’t recall the rest of what happened that evening in the country store.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-carolyn-bryant-donham-still-alive></span>Is Carolyn Bryant Donham Still Alive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Carolyn Bryant Donham Emmett is still alive and well at the age of 85 in 2022 today. People are distraught because she lied, and as a result of her lie, a boy was murdered. Some tweets, “She is deserving of prison time”.</p><p>Despite Carolyn Bryant Donham’s recantation of her earlier testimony, the FBI was unable to prove she lied, so Carolyn Bryant Donham was acquitted, whereas Emmett Till’s family was devastated when the case was closed.</p><p>When the police decided to close the case, they sent a letter to the family. They expressed their condolences in this letter. You can see Emmett’s family’s reaction to the news above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuRp7ytxc1mmauxkaPBbrDOp5%2BapV2stqy1z56bopldrLWmvsRmoKxlo52ybsDOnZiyZZmoerS0xGaqraGcoXqiuMivnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
