She lives a low-key life, in contrast to her celebrity father, who is constantly surrounded by the media.</p><p>She is also not on social media because she is too young to have one. Her father and mother aren’t on social media either.</p><p>Shanahan is currently spending time with her parents, Mandy and Kyle Shanahan, who have been married for fifteen years. She is the tyrant who prefers to spend time with her siblings Carter and Lexi Louise.</p><p>Stella is the well-known child of an extremely private but endearing couple who rarely speak openly about their personal lives.
