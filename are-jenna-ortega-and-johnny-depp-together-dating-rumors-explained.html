Even though anything can happen in the unpredictable world of Hollywood, is there any substantial basis for these rumors?</p><h2 id=h-is-jenna-ortega-dating-johnny-depp data-injectable=false>Is Jenna Ortega dating Johnny Depp?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jenna-and-Johnny.jpg><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>The rumors of Jenna Ortega dating Johnny Depp gained immense attention and elicited plenty of discussions on social media. The speculations soon reached the two actors, who have since come forward to set things straight. Jenna, who is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">currently shooting for&nbsp;Beetlejuice 2</a>, responded to rumors on her Instagram account and wrote in a now-expired story:</p><p>“This is so ridiculous I can’t even laugh. I have never met or worked with Johnny Depp in my life. Please stop spreading lies and leave us alone.”</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>The rumors also reached Johnny Depp, who is now <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reclaiming his position in Hollywood</a> after struggling for months during the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Depp v. Heard defamation trial</a> that cost him his reputation and career at the time. The actor’s representatives issued an official statement, as reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NME</a>, categorically dismissing the dating rumors as “baseless and malicious”:</p><p>“Mr. Depp has no personal or professional relationship with Ms. Ortega whatsoever. He has never met her or spoken to her. He is not involved in any project with her, nor does he intend to be. He is appalled by these baseless and malicious rumors that are intended to harm his reputation and career.”</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>The rumors gained huge traction partly because of the previous year’s unconfirmed rumors about Depp’s involvement in&nbsp;Beetlejuice 2. The actor reportedly appeared on the cast list on Google searches&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside Michael Keaton</a>&nbsp;and Winona Ryder, leading to excitement among fans (via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail)</a>. Now, reports of him being spotted with Ortega caused fans to believe he might actually be in the film, leading to speculation that the dating rumors might be true.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>But clearly, the dating speculations are a hoax and hold no basis or proof to them. The account that initially propagated this outlandish rumor explicitly states in its bio that the information it publishes is not grounded in fact. Both Ortega and Depp quickly reacted to the situation and requested everyone to stop fueling the rumors further.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Sus7GMo5ynppFivLPAxKCYZpmemXqru8enpbJllJq9sXnTqJ6erJiav26wwK2gp59dp8Kuu9GsZJ6woKGuqrrEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
