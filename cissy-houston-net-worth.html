Her parents, Nitcholas Drinkard and Delia Mae Drinkard, moved from Georgia to New Jersey during the Great Migration. They strongly encouraged their children to pursue education and actively participate in the church. Cissy Houston began singing in church and attended South Side High School.</p><p>Tragedy struck Houston from a young age, as her mother suffered a stroke and died of a cerebral hemorrhage when Houston was only eight years old. When she turned 18, her father passed away from stomach cancer, leading her to live with one of her older siblings.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>During her childhood, Houston joined the gospel singing group called the Drinkard Four, later renamed the Drinkard Singers. She made her television debut on TV Gospel Time during this time. The group regularly performed at church and recorded a live album titled “A Joyful Noise” under the RCA label.</p><p>As Houston grew older, she formed the group the Sweet Inspirations in 1963 along with Doris Troy and Dee Dee Warwick.

Although she had previously recorded solo tracks, this album marked her official solo debut. She also had a recording contract with James Records during the early 1970s and released several singles. One notable recording was Jim Weatherly’s “Midnight Train to Georgia,” which became a number one hit when Gladys Knight & The Pips released their version.</p><p>In 1977, Houston signed with Private Stock Records and released three albums produced by Michael Zager.

In 1996, she won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album for her album “Face to Face” and won a second Grammy in 1998 for her album “He Leadeth Me.” She has also performed alongside her daughter Whitney Houston on several occasions.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 1955, Houston married Freddie Garland and had a son named Gary Garland, who later became an NBA basketball player. However, the couple divorced before their son’s birth.</p><p>In 1958, Houston began a relationship with John Houston while he was still married. They had two children together, Michael and Whitney Houston. Once John’s divorce was finalized in 1964, he and Cissy got married the following month. John Houston became Cissy’s manager during her time with the Sweet Inspirations. However, their relationship eventually soured, and they legally separated in 1991, though remaining married until 1991.</p><p>Cissy Houston was tragically thrust into the spotlight due to her daughter Whitney’s struggles with drug addiction. She made numerous efforts to seek treatment and support rehabilitation programs for her daughter. Sadly, Whitney Houston passed away in February 2012 in Los Angeles. Cissy Houston publicly expressed her frustration with how the media mishandled the coverage of her daughter’s tragedy. In 2013, she released a book titled “Remembering Whitney: My Story of Love, Loss, and the Night the Music Stopped,” which detailed her daughter’s life and tragic demise.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth_Over_Time></span>Net Worth Over Time<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Throughout Cissy Houston’s career, her net worth has reached $6 million.
