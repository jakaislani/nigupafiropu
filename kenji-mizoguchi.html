I was not familiar with TotalFilm.com, until I spotted a link over at Movie City News. Thanks a lot, guys.
The link was to a pair of articles listing Total Film's choices for &#34;The Greatest Directors Ever&#34; Part 1 (100 - 49) and Part 2 (50 - 1).

I think probably not. Why am I linking to it now? Because it's my shameless attempt to stimulate discussion, which I hope will be on a more informed level than this list. Or maybe it's just to have a laugh. Or a moment of sadness. What do I think of the list itself? Well, let's see:</p><p>Baz Luhrmann is #97.</p><p>Tony Scott is #74, just edging out Milos Forman, Kenji Mizoguchi, Satyajit Ray, Carl Theodor Dreyer, and Buster Keaton, who comes in at #88.</p><p>Bryan Singer is #65, two slots below Robert Bresson, who immediately follows Sam Raimi.</p><p>Rob Reiner is #35.</p><p>Michael Mann (#28) is on the list, but Anthony Mann is not.</p><p>Bernardo Bertolucci is... not on the list.</p><p>Otto Preminger is... not on the list.</p><p>Richard Lester is... not on the list.</p><p>Rainer Werner Fassbinder is... not on the list.</p><p>Max Ophuls is... not on the list.</p><p>George Cukor is... not on the list, but George Lucas (#95) is.</p><p>Andrei Tarkovsky is... not on the list.</p><p>Eric Rohmer is... not on the list.</p><p>Claude Chabrol is... not on the list.</p><p>Luchino Visconti is... not on the list.</p><p>Vittorio De Sica is... not on the list.</p><p>Michelangelo Antonioni is... not on the list. Not even the top 100.</p><p>What's worse are the little names they have for each director. Sophia Coppola (#99) is "The dreamer" ("Dreamy, brave and cool, this Coppola is doing it for herself"). Singer is "The new Spielberg." Robert Altman (#26) is "The outsider" -- oops, but so is Hal Ashby (#58). Somebody ran out of labels. Well, at least they are not outside all alone; they are outside together. Sam Fuller (#50) is "The hack." Mike Leigh (#49) is "The grouch." Quentin Tarantino (#12) is "The motormouth."</p><p>OK, that's enough. Have at it if you feel like it. If you don't feel like it, you'll probably live.</p><p>ADDENDUM: A reader, spleendonkey, describes TotalFilm as a British magazine aimed at teens and pre-teens, designed to broaden their film horizons.
