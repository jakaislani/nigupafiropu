Her life was tragically cut short due to injuries sustained in an automobile accident, leaving a void in the hearts of her family, friends, and the community.

Delaine, born in Joliet, Illinois, on April 15, 1956, was the daughter of the late Len Earl Sparks and Rachel Mann Sparks.

Additionally, she said goodbye to her father-in-law and mother-in-law, William “Cherry” Crisp and Pauline Crisp. These hardships only strengthened her resolve to cherish her remaining family and make the most of life. Delaine was an active member of the Pennville Church of Christ, where she found solace, purpose, and a deep sense of community. She shared her faith by serving as a Nursery class teacher and being a guiding presence for the congregation.</p><p>One of Delaine’s defining passions was her talent for carving, particularly intricate Santa Claus figures.

Delaine also found joy in embroidery, crochet, drawing, and all forms of crafts, constantly nurturing her creative spirit and sharing her talents with her family and friends. She had a love for thrifting and yard sales, a hobby she shared with her daughters, bonding over the thrill of discovering hidden treasures. These shared adventures created countless cherished memories and strengthened the bonds within their family.</p><p>Delaine is survived by her loving husband, Nolan, who stood by her side through the highs and lows of life. She is also survived by her daughter and son-in-law, Misty and Robert McQuese, her son-in-law, Anthony McWhorter, and her adored grandchildren, Noah McQuese, Eli McQuese, Will McWhorter, Owen McWhorter, and Ava McQuese.

Delaine’s final resting place will be in the West Hill Cemetery.</p><p>The pallbearers, chosen to carry Delaine to her final resting place, are Noah McQuese, Eli McQuese, Will McWhorter, Ronnie McKeehan, Jeremy Worsham, and Stanley Mann. Honorary pallbearers include Jeff and Kathy Bennett, Johnny and Kay Brimer, Mike and Janice Bowers, Leslie and Freda Shadrick, Randy and Beverly Young, and the Ladies of the Pennville Church of Christ, a testament to the impact she had on her congregation and community.
