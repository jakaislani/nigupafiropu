Recommended Videos The fourth season of Netflix’s hit show You has brought Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) to London, where he quickly gained another obsession. This time his victim/love interest is his neighbor, Kate Galvin (Charlotte Ritchie). Halfway through the first season, it is revealed that Kate is holding something back from Joe, that her father is a powerful businessman whose dealings have done a lot of harm."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Halfway through the first season, it is revealed that Kate is holding something back from Joe, that her father is a powerful businessman whose dealings have done a lot of harm.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>We didn’t get to see Kate’s father in the first half of the first season, but now that Netflix has dropped the second half we know who her father, Tom Lockwood, is. If you don’t recognize the actor who plays him, it is none other than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Greg Kinnear</a>. Let’s take a look at Kinnear’s career in case you have forgotten where you might have seen him before.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-is-greg-kinnear-the-actor-who-plays-tom-lockwood-in-you data-injectable=false>Who is Greg Kinnear, the actor who plays Tom Lockwood in You?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Greg-Kinnear-in-Friends.jpg><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>You would be forgiven if you did not recognize Greg Kinnear, as he hasn’t been in too many projects recently. But, he was in Shining Vale and Apple TV Plus’s Black Bird. He was also recently in the miniseries The Stand, where he played Glen Bateman. If you have a better memory than most you might remember Kinnear from his stellar career in the 1990s.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=809 data-injectable=true>He played David Larrabee in the Harrison Ford movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina</a>, and he was Simon Bishop in As Good as It Gets. Kinnear also played Richard Hoover in Little Miss Sunshine, and who could forget his role as Frank in the Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan romantic comedy, You’ve Got Mail. He was in The Gift and Baby Mama as well. If animated films are more your speed, you might recognize his voice from the 2005 film Robots – where he voiced the villain Ratchet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/you-season-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/you-season-4-cast.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/joe-you-netflix.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/you-season-4-part-1-review.png><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>If you are more of a television fan, he also appeared on an episode of Friends where he played Charlie’s (Aisha Tyler) ex-boyfriend. She broke up with Ross to get back together with him in an iconic season 10 episode. Kinnear also showed up in an episode of Modern Family, and he played himself in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Ultimately, he might be best remembered for being the host of Talk Soup.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=735 data-injectable=false>Greg Kinnear usually doesn’t play such villainous roles, as you might have guessed looking at the rest of his filmography. It usually doesn’t work out well for people who go up against Joe in the series, so Tom Lockwood’s future isn’t looking great. To watch his appearance in You, you can catch all four seasons on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mp6WZqah6tbvMZqOom5usvLCwjKKlZrGfqnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
