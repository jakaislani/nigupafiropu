Not unlike the remnants of an exploded planet, it has fortunately been picking up speed since SyFy officially <a href=#>ordered a pilot</a> this past May.</p><p data-characters=652 data-current-count=894 data-injectable=true>For those unfamiliar with the concept,&nbsp;Krypton intends to follow the adventures of Superman/Kal-El’s grandfather, Seg-El, who is on a quest to redeem the besmirched name of his family. I guess we could call this a prequel series, but I’m half-tempted to refer to it as a prequel to a prequel even though it has no connection to&nbsp;Smallville, which was a wonderful series that ran for ten seasons and chronicled Superman’s formative years. With&nbsp;Gotham currently enjoying much success over at Fox, perhaps someone at WB feels there’s still much material to mine when it comes to the lineages of its most recognizable superheroes.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>The most recent bit of news is rather interesting as the show has found its female lead in Georgina Campbell, who’s set to play Lyta Zod (apparently, their family scoffs at hyphens in this continuity). Her character’s description bears more juicy details (via <a href=#>Deadline</a>):</p><p>Campbell’s Lyta Zod&nbsp;is a&nbsp;member of Krypton’s military caste and the daughter of a general, Alura Zod. Lyta Zod serves as a cadet — and has also been having a clandestine, forbidden romance with Seg-El (not cast yet).</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>The first thing that caught my attention was that her mother’s name is Alura. We know that to be the first name of Supergirl’s biological mother, Alura Zor-El, but it we may find it to be a common name on Krypton.</p><p data-characters=638 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>As for Lyta’s “forbidden romance” with Seg-El, one has to wonder if this will lead to the two respective bloodlines uniting or if it leads to a deep animosity set to culminate in Superman and Dru-Zod’s (that’s technically the full name of the villain known to the mainstream simply as “General Zod”) inevitable rivalry. Should they actually produce a child, it wouldn’t be unheard of as the iconic supervillain was actually named Zod-El in the&nbsp;Superman: Earth One line of books. With various comic book inspirations to choose from, the producers can undoubtedly keep viewers on their toes.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>Executive produced by David S. Goyer and Damian Kindler, SyFy’s&nbsp;<strong>Krypton</strong> does not currently have a projected air date, but we’ll keep you posted once we hear more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ysvtipq6imXZu2r7DSZp2epZGhsm64xJqbZp%2BVpL%2Botc2aZJyZnaWvprjLaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
