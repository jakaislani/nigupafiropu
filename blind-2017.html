At least this trio can still summon just enough star shine to keep audiences mindlessly crunching their popcorn. That is especially true of Baldwin, whose Trump-inspired antics both on “Saturday Night Live” and in the animated hit “<a href=#>The Boss Baby</a>” have elevated his presence of late.&nbsp;</p><p>Harder to swallow is the stale taste left behind by what happens onscreen in “Blind,”&nbsp; the directing debut of <a href=#>Michael Mailer</a> (eldest son of novelist <a href=#>Norman Mailer</a>), with a script by brother <a href=#>John Buffalo Mailer</a>. Here is a sample: In an early scene, a high-stakes power couple, consisting of a hubristic wheeler-dealer Mark Dutchman (McDermott) and Moore as his chilly yet compliantly dutiful trophy wife Suzanne, are preparing to head out to celebrate their 19th anniversary. Running late, she is on the phone on one side of the wall in their bedroom making sure they can keep their dinner reservation. Meanwhile, he is on the phone on the other side plotting to engage in some unethical financial deal. But before they leave, he presents her with a box. What could it be?</p><p>Of course, it’s that most ancient of high-end, guilt-assuaging spousal gift clichés, a diamond necklace. He lovingly places a cascading waterfall of jewels around her neck while the city that provides their panoramic penthouse view seemingly glitters with envy in the nighttime sky. But, in this case, it might as well be a choke collar.</p><p>While in the car later, Mark’s true alpha nature comes out when his wife tells him she would like to go back to work as an executive editor. He forbids it because, “I need all your attention on me right now, all of it.” It is easy to surmise that this me-first dude will soon get his just deserts. Payback, in fact, is just around the corner after a business associate is caught in a sting involving an undercover cop posing as a hooker. To save his skin, he rats out Mark. Soon Mr. Big is bedecked in drab prison garb and no chance of bail. Nonetheless, this wolf of Wall Street assures Suzanne, who is blithely unaware of whatever her underhanded hubby has been up to, that they and their pampered lifestyle will be just fine despite stashing his illegal gains in their private family account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bo6KmlGJ%2FcX2W</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
