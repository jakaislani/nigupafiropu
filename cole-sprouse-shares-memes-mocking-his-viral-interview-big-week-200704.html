"I looked around and I was like, 'So, are you DTF?' She goes, 'What?' And I go, 'You know, down to f**k?' I was 14. She looked at me and she was like, 'Sure.'"</span></p><p><span>He also opened up about his 2020 split from Reinhart and having to return to work on their CW show.</span></p><p><span>"It was really hard. It was really hard for both of us," he said of the split. "I think the work thing got difficult because it was hard to suspend all the way we felt about each other and it didn't afford us the luxury of distance to really overcome that. I know we both did quite a bit of damage to each other in that."</span></p><p><strong><span>RELATED CONTENT:</span></strong></p><p class=label>Video</p><a class=title href=#>Cole Sprouse Discusses How Hard it Is to ‘Keep Your Head on Straight’ in Hollywood</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Cole Sprouse Talks Lili Reinhart Split, Losing Virginity at 14</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Cole Sprouse's Girlfriend Shares PDA Photos for His 30th Birthday</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Why Cole Sprouse Is 'Violently Defensive' of Past Female Disney Stars</span></h3></a>Related Photos<a href=# aria-label="Must-See Celeb Sightings: March 2023"><span class=slidecount>125 Photos</span></a><a href=# aria-label="Must-See Celeb Sightings: March 2023"><span>Must-See Celeb Sightings: March 2023</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7psDOp6OippVjsLC5jpympZ1dqL2zu9SsnGarmJa%2Fpr%2BMppymnaNiurCvyqKloGWYnsBuwsirmKVlmaPBpr7VopywZZKetG7DxJ6iZmpgZYRxgA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
