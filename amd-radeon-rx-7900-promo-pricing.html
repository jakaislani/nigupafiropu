Better still, AMD's board partners have already reduced prices further than AMD's official program/projections, and we're seeing RX 7900 XTs drop to <a href=#>as low as $710 in the U.S.</a>, making for a $90 drop from where prices stood a few weeks ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, AMD is also technically bringing down prices on the China and OEM-only Radeon RX 7900 GRE as well. Though as this isn't available for stand-alone purchase on North American shelves, it's mostly only of relevance for OEM pre-builds (and the mark-ups they charge).</p><p>Ultimately, the fact that this is "promotional pricing" should be underscored. The new pricing on the RX 7900 XT is not, at least for the moment, a permanent price cut. Meaning that AMD is leaving themselves some formal room to raise prices later on, if they choose to. Though in practice, it would be surprising to see card prices rebound – at least so long as we don't get a new crypto boom or the like.</p><p>Finally, to sweeten the pot, AMD is also extending their latest game bundle offer for another few weeks. The company is offering a copy of <a href=#>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>&nbsp;with all Radeon RX 7000 video cards (and select Ryzen 7000 CPUs) through January 30, 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH9yfpJvZpqllGK%2ForDEqKVmqqhihHp8j2anq6edpHqxvsicoKef</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
