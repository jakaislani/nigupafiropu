In season 28, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joey Graziadei</a> traveled to Niagara Falls, Ontario with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maria Georgas</a>, Becker, Minnesota with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daisy Kent</a>, New Orleans, Louisiana with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelsey Anderson</a>, and Rancho Cucamonga, California with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel Nance</a></strong>, however, the latter seems to have gotten the short end of the stick…</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=552 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>On each and every date, the contestant showed Joey a glimpse into their life beyond the beloved competition series — with Maria and Joey soaking up the scenery at Niagara Falls, Daisy and Joey frolicking around her Christmas tree farm, and Kelsey and Joey riding a tandem bike and exploring the Big Easy — prior to meeting the family. Coming as a surprise to viewers, Rachel did not appear to have a hometown date, jumping straight into meeting the family instead, leaving fans of the Bachelor franchise with just one burning question: Why?</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Contrary to popular belief, after splicing together screenshots from various Bachelor previews this season, it looks like Rachel indeed had a hometown date, giving the Bachelor himself a glimpse into her life as a nurse. Given that this segment was cut from the hit competition show, viewers were not happy, arguing via social media that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Hawaii native</a> has been being mistreated all season long.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by bachelor nation (@bachelorettewindmill)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>“The editors have been doing Rachel dirty all season but this is really the icing on top of the cake… She DID have a date before he met her family but they cut THE ENTIRE thing. They really don’t want people to care about her and that’s extremely odd,” @seafIwrs shared via X — formerly known as Twitter — kickstarting an extremely interesting conversation.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Some users found Rachel’s lack of screen time to be racially motivated, given that she is the only woman of color remaining:</p><p>“Of course it’s the only non-white woman left that doesn’t get her full date shown!”</p><p>“Joey was almost engaged to a black woman last season, had one of the most diverse casts, and the only woman of color in his top 3 gets zero storyline???? And she has 22k followers and the next one (Kelsey A) has over 100k. wtf!!!!!”</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>Others argued that Rachel’s date was cut from television because she is “boring” in comparison to Maria, Daisy, and Kelsey:</p><p>“Orrrrrrrr maybe it was very very dry? I don’t see their chemistry maybe they were trying to maintain what was left of their TV chemistry so hometowns wouldn’t come across weird af on national tv.”</p><p>“Honestly, it’s probably because she comes off as boring, which isn’t really fair, but that’s what they made us think about her and people aren’t as invested in their storyline.”</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>For whatever reason her hometown date was scrapped, fans of the Bachelor franchise used this as evidence that she will not receive the final rose at the end of the beloved competition series, and we seriously could not agree more. As much as we would love for Rachel and Joey to find love with one another, she is simply not getting a winner’s edit…</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, to find out for yourself who gets engaged to Joey, as well as what the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unprecedented ending</a>” to The Bachelor season 28 will consist of, catch brand new episodes each and every Monday on ABC, or stream them the following day on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMCtqmamn6l6p63Iq2Stp12dsrN50ZqaoZ2cYruiusKeZKGZlGKubrTOppytp6ejeqWt055kraCRqXq4rdJmnJ2hpJqxbrvUrWSonl2ptaZ5wZqaoZ2cpL9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
